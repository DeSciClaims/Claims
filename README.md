# Claims Subnet RFC

This repository is a lightweight, public-facing guide to the proposed Claims subnet.

It is intentionally not a production codebase. The goal is to make the shape of the subnet easy to understand for reviewers, partners, and potential miners or validators:

- What a paper-level task looks like
- What a miner is expected to return
- How a validator might score that output
- How the prototype claim graph objects fit together

The examples and scripts are deliberately minimal and hard-coded. They are meant to illustrate protocol shape, not implementation detail.

## What Is In This Repo

- Short RFC notes describing the proposed subnet
- Simplified JSON Schemas for the prototype claim graph objects
- Mock miner and validator scripts that run on example JSON files
- Example payloads for valid and invalid miner outputs
- Small tests that validate the repo's demonstration flow

## What Is Not In This Repo

- Full extraction pipelines
- Production networking or storage layers
- Model-serving infrastructure
- Customer-specific ontology systems
- Economic mechanism implementation beyond a simple sketch

## Core Idea

The canonical object model in this repo follows `claims_subnet/PROTOTYPE_CLAIM_GRAPH_SCHEMA.md`.

- `Paper`
- `Span`
- `Claim`
- `EvidenceItem`
- `ClaimEvidenceLink`

The miner demo returns an extraction artifact containing those objects. Validators score the artifact for shape, grounding to spans, and relation consistency.

## Quickstart

Run the end-to-end demo:

```bash
python scripts/run_demo.py
```

Validate an example payload:

```bash
python scripts/validate_payload.py examples/miner_outputs/extraction.valid.json schemas/extraction.schema.json
```

Score an example miner output:

```bash
python scripts/score_payload.py examples/miner_outputs/extraction.valid.json
```

Run tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Design Notes

- The canonical terms in this repo come from `claims_subnet/PROTOTYPE_CLAIM_GRAPH_SCHEMA.md`.
- The public demo keeps the prototype object model small and readable.
- The example domain is biomedical, but the shape is domain-agnostic.
- Ontology enhancement uses the same `SemanticField` and `OntologyAnnotation` pattern everywhere.

## Suggested Reading Order

1. `rfc/0001-overview.md`
2. `rfc/0002-miner-task.md`
3. `rfc/0003-validator-scoring.md`
4. `rfc/0004-schema.md`
5. `scripts/run_demo.py`

## Status

This repository is a communication artifact for early review. It should be read as an RFC and demo scaffold, not as a final subnet spec.
